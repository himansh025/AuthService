}

Security

Spring Security with SecurityFilterChain for stateless authentication.

JWTFilter validates tokens for protected endpoints.

Public endpoints: /auth/signup, /auth/signin, /api/*.

Passwords encrypted using BCryptPasswordEncoder.

Spring Security Configuration Example:


Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>


Configure MySQL database in application.properties.

Run the service using Spring Boot:

./gradlew bootRun


Use /auth/signup to register a passenger and /auth/signin to obtain a JWT token.
